Don't use system( "clear" ); in C/C++ in Mac OS.
Causes random Seg Faults in printf statements...
Works on Linux properly though :/

Update:
That was actually fault of deallocating memory before the usage of data..
-_-
Anyways, still, use system(...) only if extremely needed and find a better solution
for clearing screen than that...
